# Kahoot-JS

Watch the YouTube video to see how it works

[![App Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6w9cnCC1VI8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w9cnCC1VI8)

The project is inspired by the [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com) app. The main functionality of the application is the creation of educational games in the form of quizzes, which then can be solved by several students at the same time in the form of a game. Quizzes can be created with the use of a special wizard that allows you to select the type of question, determine the method of awarding points and answer time for a particular question, and the number of correct answers. During the quiz, the teacher acts as the host who creates a room that students can access using an access code. During the game, students see the scoreboards after each question in real time. Quizzes are divided into public and private. Each logged in user can view the list of public quizzes, add likes and comments to them.

## Contributing

As this is my first project in the Javascript ecosystem, most of the code needs to be refactored or rewritten :) There are a lot of bugs in the code, which I'm sure you'll find quickly.

Also many new features needs to be added to call this project as a full-fledged Kahoot clone.

Feel free to contribute.
